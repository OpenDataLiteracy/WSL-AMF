# Exploring Library Curation of State Government Open Data

## Description  
*In three to five sentences describe the project, sponsor, and relevant information about the summer internship you will be working on. Be sure to include a sentence about the key stakeholders that will be served.*

The Washington state [open data portal](https://data.wa.gov/browse?limitTo=datasets) currently hosts 492 datasets (as of 10 June 2019) dating back to 2012. As part of its work to encourage open data best practices and use, the Washington State Library would like to investigate the feasibility of curating these datasets for the state and assess how the portal can be improved. To inform this work, University of Washington Open Data Literacy intern, Andrew Mckenna-Foster, will assess datasets for data and metadata quality, interview users of the data portal, and identify factors that may account for poor circulation or high use. The key stakeholders are both the WA State Library and the State of Washington data managers.

## Project Duration

17 June - 16 August 2019

## Goals     
*What is this project supposed to achieve, and why?*

- Provide a literature review based on a bibliography of relevant and recent references. 
- Identify datasets with poor data quality and poor metadata quality
- Understand how the portal is perceived and used by users  (depositors)
- Identify factors behind poor circulation or high circulation of datasets
- Produce a final report

### Out of scope
Any editing, remediation, publishing, or curation of datasets.

### Time allowing
A site visit to one of the libraries for which the State Library is providing open data consulting services. This may involve too much travel but could be useful informing recommendations for the state data portal.  

## Deliverables    
*What will this project produce? This should include items like reports, best practices, software, data, metadata schemas, models or figures, and documentation. See the two types of deliverables below:*

### Interim     
- Literature review 
- Assessment of data and metadata quality
- Draft survey/interview questions for depositors and users
- Results from the survey/interviews
- List of factors behind the poor circulation or high circulation of datasets
- Two blogposts

### End of project

- Report presenting information to help future decision making around the WA state data portal
- Public presentation on 16 August 2019


## Plan for Sustainability       
*Describe how you will manage deliverables during the project and the plan for handing over, and sustaining deliverables over time. We require that all internships create open documentation and update their plans for sustainability regularly.*

I will be in regular contact with Kathleen Sullivan and OD. I will store all files created for the project on github. The github repository for this project will be available for future use and will be findable through ODL.

## Milestones    
*Create a general timeline for completing each of the deliverables that you listed above. After you have settled on a timeline with feedback from your mentor, you should enter these as `Milestones` in Github's `Issues` tracker. Each task that you perform or plan to perform can then be files as an issue that is attached to a specific milestone.*

### Milestone #1 - Literature Review
- Literature Review *21 June*

### Milestone #2 - Data and Metadata Quality Assessment
- Identify variables for data and metadata quality assessment *28 June*
- Assess at least 25% of datasets *26 July*
- Review data published in other formats (maps, images 
- Summarize assessment data *9 August*

### Milestone #3 - User Interviews
- Draft interview questions *28 June*
- Contact interviewees *1 July*
- Complete interviews *26 July*
- Analyze and summarize interview data *2 August*

### Milestone #4 - Circulation Factors
- Propose factors behind circulation rates based on literature review *26 June*
- Assess datasets for those factors *12 July*

### Milestone #5 Final Report and Presentation
- Write report *16 August*
- Create presentation *16 August*

## Communication

- [Customize and add bullets]
- Update the ODL GitHub repository at least weekly and more as needed, so the internshipâ€™s documentation is current and thorough.
- Notify Kathleen Sullivan and others as needed about updated reports.
- Meet with Kathleen either in person or through Zoom once a week or as needed.
- Respond to Kathleen Sullivan or ODL team within 24 business hours.
- Use Zoom, email, and Slack for communication with Kathleen Sullivan and the ODL team.
- Include any travel, online meetings, and/or site visits planned...
