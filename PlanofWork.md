# Project Title

## Description  
In three to five sentences describe the project, sponsor, and relevant information about the summer internship you will be working on. Be sure to include a sentence about the key stakeholders that will be served. 

The Washington state [open data portal](https://data.wa.gov/browse?limitTo=datasets) currently hosts 492 datasets (as of 10June 2019) dating back to 2012.  As part of its work to encourage open data best practices and use, the Washington State Library would like to investigate the feasability of curating these datasets for the state and assess how the portal can be improved.  To inform this work my internship will involve assessing datasets for data and metadata quality, interviewing users of the data portal, and identifying factors that may account for poor circulation or high use.  I will also collect information on data portals from other states to put the WA state portal in a national context.  The key stakeholders are both the WA State Library and the State of Washington data managers.

## Goals     
What is this project supposed to achieve, and why?

- Identify datasets with poor data quality and poor metadata quality
- Understand how the portal is perceived and used by users  (depositors)
- Identify factors behind poor circulation or high circulation of datasets
- Provide a comparison of the WA state portal and other state data portals
- Produce a final report

### Out of scope
Optional section, but nice to have when out of scope work starts to creep in...  

### Time allowing
Include work that may happen if given enough time.

## Deliverables    
What will this project produce? This should include items like reports, best practices, software, data, metadata schemas, models or figures, and documentation. See the two types of deliverables below: 

### Interim

### End of project

## Plan for Sustainability       
Describe how you will manage deliverables during the project and the plan for handing over, and sustaining deliverables over time. We require that all internships create open documentation and update their plans for sustainability regularly.

## Milestones    
Create a general timeline for completing each of the deliverables that you listed above. After you have settled on a timeline with feedback from your mentor, you should enter these as `Milestones` in Github's `Issues` tracker. Each task that you perform or plan to perform can then be files as an issue that is attached to a specific milestone.
