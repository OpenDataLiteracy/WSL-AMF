# Project Title

## Description  
*In three to five sentences describe the project, sponsor, and relevant information about the summer internship you will be working on. Be sure to include a sentence about the key stakeholders that will be served.*

The Washington state [open data portal](https://data.wa.gov/browse?limitTo=datasets) currently hosts 492 datasets (as of 10 June 2019) dating back to 2012.  As part of its work to encourage open data best practices and use, the Washington State Library would like to investigate the feasability of curating these datasets for the state and assess how the portal can be improved.  To inform this work my internship will involve assessing datasets for data and metadata quality, interviewing users of the data portal, and identifying factors that may account for poor circulation or high use.  I will also collect information on data portals from other states to put the WA state portal in a national context.  The key stakeholders are both the WA State Library and the State of Washington data managers.

## Goals     
What is this project supposed to achieve, and why?

- Provide a literature review based on a bibliography of relevant and recent references. 
- Identify datasets with poor data quality and poor metadata quality
- Understand how the portal is perceived and used by users  (depositors)
- Identify factors behind poor circulation or high circulation of datasets
- Provide a comparison of the WA state portal and other state data portals
- Produce a final report

### Out of scope
Optional section, but nice to have when out of scope work starts to creep in...  

### Time allowing
Include work that may happen if given enough time.

## Deliverables    
*What will this project produce? This should include items like reports, best practices, software, data, metadata schemas, models or figures, and documentation. See the two types of deliverables below:*

Report
 

### Interim     
- A literature review 
- An assessment of data and metadata quality
- A draft survey/interview questions for users
- Results from the survey/interviews
- A list of factors behind the poor circulation or high circulation of datasets
- A file of features and practices from other state data portals

### End of project
*- A Final deliverable that will be completed at the end of the project (Many interim deliverables will likely add up to a final deliverable)*

This project will produce a report clearly presenting information to help future decision making around the WA state data portal.  It will contain a summary of the data and metadata quality assessment identifying the most common violations of open data best practices.  The report will contain figures for visualizing both assessment data and responses from user surveys and an analysis of the factors behind dataset circulation. 


## Plan for Sustainability       
*Describe how you will manage deliverables during the project and the plan for handing over, and sustaining deliverables over time. We require that all internships create open documentation and update their plans for sustainability regularly.*

I will be in regular contact with Kathleen Sullivan and will store all files created for the project on github. 

## Milestones    
Create a general timeline for completing each of the deliverables that you listed above. After you have settled on a timeline with feedback from your mentor, you should enter these as `Milestones` in Github's `Issues` tracker. Each task that you perform or plan to perform can then be files as an issue that is attached to a specific milestone.

## Communication

- [Customize and add bullets]
- Update the ODL GitHub repository at least weekly and more as needed, so the internshipâ€™s documentation is current and thorough. Notify Kathleen Sullivan and others as needed about updated reports.
- Respond to Kathleen Sullivan or ODL team within 24 business hours.
- Use [platforms determined by intern and sponsor], email, and Slack for communication with Kathleen Sullivan and the ODL team.
- Include any travel, online meetings, and/or site visits planned...
