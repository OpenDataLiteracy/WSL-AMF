## README

This folder is for a possible Jupyter notebook containing python code that creates visualizations for the asset dataset for data.wa.gov 

The socrata-all-metadata notebook harvests detailed metadata from socrata for all published tabular datasets.  It creates charts, saves a csv of the dataset (with a column counting data dictionary completeness), and adds summary data to a csv log file for longitudinal analysis.

The top-by-state takes the top datasets from 17 Socrata state portals and saves them as a csv file.
