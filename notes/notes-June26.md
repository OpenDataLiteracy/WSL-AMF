## June 26 Notes

Met with State GIS Coordinator with Kathleen. They want to produce a flyer that may encourage librarians to use the state mapping resources.

Kathleen asked about how towns that have historical, georeference-able data can take advantage of state systems to get data online.

Agenda for tomorrow's virtual meeting:

1. Update on progress
 * Interview scheduling is underway.
 * Created an assessment framework.
 



Questions for Will:
1. Can I make a practice dataset to see what metadata the publishers have access to?
2. Are the all metadata elements in the report of all datasets available to publishers?
3. Have you been deleting (or unpublishing datasets?)
