## July 12 Notes

Emailed followthemoney.org to set up an interview.



**Had a meeting with Will and Kathleen over Zoom**

I reviewed what I've been working on.

Some useful tips from Will:
- Licenses may be blank because there is a dispute within the State about what an agency can claim as licensable
 - Some say data is owned by the public and there for cannot be licensable
 - Others say agencies can put a public domain license on data
- Some agencies may be acting on the advice of council when not adding a license.
- A solution may involve the state creating a non commercial license

- Will thinks a key area for future work will be identifying key datasets for the portal and creating a measure of what percent of those are available
- Will reiterated his thought that data.wa.gov is like a library made up of donated material
- He provided background on what it is really a publisher's portal rather than a user's portal
 - Users used to be able to create and publish views, but abuse forced that to be shut down
 - Will would like some way to hear the voice of the 'patrons'
