## June 27 Notes


Phone call with Kathleen and Will:

Gave an update on progress

1. Interview scheduling is underway.
 * Kathleen suggested starting out with an introductory question asking person when, how or what.
 * Will suggeste talking with Emily Rang at OPSI and Michael Mann at LEAP. Maybe Tim Minter, Washington State Department of Social and Health Services
 * There was discussion that including agencies that either do not post at all or post in odd ways.  It turns out RCO is one of those: Posts on behaf of Governer's Salmon effort and provides IT support
 
2. Created an assessment framework.
 * Kathleen suggested 
  * Taking a sample of the sample and look closely at the keywords- are they actually helpful
  * Taking a sample of the sample and assess the dataset for possible users, usefulness
  * Inlcude something about currency- when were datasets updated?
  * In report, include comments about the different download patterns for datasets versus views- potentially different user groups


Questions for Will:

1. Can I make a practice dataset to see what metadata the publishers have access to?
 8 Yes
2. Are the all metadata elements in the report of all datasets available to publishers?
 * Everything in the report should be fillable either by system or by publisher.  I will go throug upload process and use only fields available to publiser for assessment.
3. Have you been deleting (or unpublishing datasets?)
 * OPSI has been doing a lot of posting and deposting
4. Possible to get IP Addresses?
 * These are not available.
5. Meeting Tuesday
