## Notes July 24

Took train down to Tumwater, getting ride back with Kathleen
Attended the Secretary of State staff appreciation picnic as well as the State Library all staff meeting.


**Update on activities**

* Have spent an inordinate amount of time learning how to manipulate json files from socrata to create summaries and visualizations of metadata
 * It seems like the best way to make what I've done reproducible- rather than clean an excel list in cryptic ways and have to redo it everytime.
* Have completed seven interviews (6 agencies and 1 user), have one scheduled, two in schuduling process and waiting to hear back from five.
* Portal assessment is basically complete (in excel)
* Dataset assessment (~115 datasets) is also complete
* Keyword assessment on the same ~115 datasets is half done
* Will was not keen on the bulletin board comparison but did conceded the curation duties were similar.  Kathleen agrees.
 * The literature on bulletin boards suggests they are unique to their communities and one of the biggest difficulties is outdated information.  I think state portals are unique to their states and a major issue is outdated/poor quality information.


**Reminders from previous notes:**

* Collection Development Policy could be a good format for a final report
* Will thinks the portal possibly should be like 'data journalism'- highly curated datasets
 * He is interested in a list of datasets that should be on the portal and an assessment of whether they are there or not
 * He would like a way to hear from users
* Both Kathleen and Will think the datasets in general are not made accessible enough (through [stories](https://data.wa.gov/stories/s/irv9-b275) or visualizations)
* Lib Guides for various users could be a useful curation activity but need standard tags (shouldn't link directly to datasets)


**Questions for Socrata:**

* In Socrata analytics, why are the search engine referalls for each search engine the exact same between story referrals and dataset referrals? does reaching the dataset or story simultaneously open the other format?
* Why would a dataset have over 900,000 pageviews but few downloads?


**A mission for the data.wa.gov:**

To provide open access to high quality datasets from state agencies that
 * Meet the needs of Washington State residents
 * Bring insight to agency operations
 * Create resources for entrepreneurship
 * Increase transparency in government
