## Notes July 24


Update on activities
* Have spent an inordinate amount of time learning how to manipulate json files from socrata to create summaries and visualizations of metadata
 * It seems like the best way to make what I've done reproducible- rather than clean an excel list in cryptic ways and have to redo it everytime.
* Have completed seven interviews (6 agencies and 1 user), have one scheduled, two in schuduling process and waiting to hear back from five.
* Portal assessment is basically complete (in excel)
* Dataset assessment (~115 datasets) is also complete
* Keyword assessment on the same ~115 datasets is half done
* Will was not keen on the bulletin board comparison but did conceded the curation duties were similar.  Kathleen agrees.


Reminders from previous notes:

* Collection Development Policy could be a good format for a final report
* Will thinks the portal possibly should be like 'data journalism'- highly curated datasets
 * He is interested in a list of datasets that should be on the portal and an assessment of whether they are there or not
 * He would like a way to hear from users
* Both Kathleen and Will think the datasets in general are not made accessible enough (through stories or visualizations)
* Lib Guides for various users could be a useful curation activity but need standard tags (shouldn't link directly to datasets)


Questions for Socrata:
* In Socrata analytics, why are the search engine referalls for each search engine the exact same between story referrals and dataset referrals?
* How can dataset have over 900000 pageviews but few downloads?


A mission for the Portal:

To provide open access to high quality datasets from state agencies
