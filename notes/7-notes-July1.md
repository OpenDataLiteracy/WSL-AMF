## Notes for July 2

Took train to Olympia

Ate some really good pizza downtown for lunch

At 2:15 talked with Chantell Krider from Recreation and Conservation.  Will let me use an office in the OCIO building. She is a sophisticated user of the portal and other systems.  RCO is looking to swtich to Power BI online rather than Tableau. She likes that the socrata platform allow visualizations to be embedded into Sharepoint.  She expects to keep using the portal at the same rate into the future- she considers it important to their work.  When she needs data from another agency she asks them to put it on the portal.  She hounds them to make sure the required metadata is accurate.

At 3 I went to the open data working group meeting hosted by Will. There were two people from Ecology, an information architect (from the state?) and several people online (including one from Department of Health).  Discussion revolved around where to go next with open data. Points made include:
* Some agencies do not put data out there because of concerns about privacy.  The do not want to lose control of their data, and perhaps have invested in agency specific data solutions and do not want to do anything else.
* It would be nice to know what percent of available data is being made open but this depends on a very difficult to find 'denominator,' the total amount of data.
* A good thing to focus on would be identifying the most useful datasets to make open and figure out ways to make that happen.  Licensing, workers comp info, salmon recoery data, etc.
