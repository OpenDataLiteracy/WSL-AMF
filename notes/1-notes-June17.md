### Afternoon Meeting

**Will Saunders**: Portal is a "halfway house" for junky data.  It best serves the more decentralized departments with PhD managers who can take advantage of the portal's services.  The portal is becoming more popular with the bigger and more centralized agencies who dump data there as a way to fulfill a service and wipe their hands of it.  The state is one removed from the citizens who it provides services to so catering to users is different.

Agencies to interview- 
- Chadd Bennett, Student Acheivement Council (long time user)
- Department of Ecology
- FWS

Saunders thinks the portal should be more like data journalism.  An example would be 'governed' data (confidential and highly currated for use), like p20 or research data, but the portal needs this in an open way.

Data needs a story- Publishers are not marketing their data, just dumping it out there.  (Kathleen- data needs an interface  with visualizations). Too many visualizations are also not good.

Another major issue is moving data from active to archive.  How do that and maintain its metadata and link to any work it was incorporated into?  


**Katheleen**: Library can identify meta/data in need of work and note what is circulating.


**Evelyn**: Should also interview an aggregator- USAFacts.


**ToDo:**
Get dates to Will for several update meetings, Fridays are best, he's gone 16July to 30July, Zoo is probably best.
Make list of interview candidates, contact them
