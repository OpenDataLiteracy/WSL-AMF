## Notes about the portal from a high level


Should have a clear policy document

Should control tag vocabulary

Should host the data that agencies source from for visualization on agency page? Does it work like this already?

Perhaps an [annual conference](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/edp_landscaping_insight_report_n4_2018.pdf) of publishers and users would help?
* Some interviewees have noted that they would like more updates on the state open data efforts. 

Why not publish the list of public datasets as a dataset?

Possible sections to include:

* Basic analytics for portal- unique visitors, etc.
* Dataset Removal options (from Nic): [NY State](https://data.ny.gov/City-Government/NYC-Open-Data-Plan-2015-List-Of-Datasets-Removed/unw7-yyit)  [NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/dataset/Dataset-Removals/tm5c-buy3)
