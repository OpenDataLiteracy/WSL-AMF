### Notes for 19 June

Went to a meeting at Timberland with Kathleen to learn about the library's new open data webpage.  Learned about details from 
Ryan Williams.  This is an outcome from Digital Equity for Main Street program.  Library receiving more information requests, especially after discussion around consolodating library work and closing branches.  This is getting ahead of the information requests.  Wroking with Tableau now and will eventually have dashboards for both the public and employees. Currently it's just excel files ready for download and it is not too hard to update.  Ryan chose datasets based on what people have asked for.

I spent most of the day looking at datasets published by various agencies as I create an interview list.


**Some things I've been thinking about:**

The portal may be in the next phase of use: agencies are used to using it and are starting to dump data there.

A librarian could make a big impact by checking new datasets for important metadata elements like:
- Descriptive title
- License
- Tags that conform to a controlled vocabulary
- Clear variable names

With a controlled vocab for tags, the librarian could make a Lib Guide for various user groups.
