## July 7 Notes

State Portals - Bare Necessities

Datasets that every state portal should have:

* Licensing
* Business lists
* Graduation rates/school stats
* Water data- quality, sources, etc
* Infrastructure saftey reports: dams, bridges, etc
* Energy usage by state buildings
* Law Enforcement data
* Fish and Game Information
* Political Spending
* Budgets and Expenditures
* Boundaries
* Municipal data for cities/towns without their own portal

Other state portals:
- TExas- similar in size to WA. Police data and swimming pools are mosted accessed
- Colorado- lots of categories (incl. one for municipal data). Water dataset are big
- Vermont- few categories, nice landing page.  Salaries is highest downloaded, up there also is heating fuel prices
