## Notes July 3

The state data portal is less like a library and more like a community bulletin board.  The main users are the people who might also post something there.  More infrequent users are those who don't post anything.  Curating a bulletin board means removing really old or beat up postings, reordering useful postings so that all are findable, and making sure that the board in general is visible to any users.

One may consider creating categories and soliciting postings from certain users to make sure the board is very useful and relevant.

Why isn't the catalog of datasets available as an open dataset?

I should go through some other state portals and note the top three data sets to make a list of core data needed for a state portal.
