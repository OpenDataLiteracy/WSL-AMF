## Notes August 5

I've started the presentation and the paper is coming along.

The Jupyter Notebook is mostly done.  I fixed several mistakes and I created a dataset today to make all final figures from.

I have not hammered down recommendations yet.  It seems like there are two modes of curation:

1. Behind the scenes desk work: Make data provider names consistent and add a drop down with a controlled vocabulary.  Figure out what datasets could be consolidated. List datasets that should be deleted or moved. Implement a deletion policy. Implement a feedback system.
2. Engagement, Forward facing:  Work with publishers in need to increase quality. Identify datasets that should be up there.  Offer assistance to smaller agencies. Help select agencies create stories. Showcase any use cases.

The fact of the matter is that curation should really serve findability and usability.  Relevant seach results should not be diluted with poor quality data and mislabeled datasets.  Information that is not [data](https://ocio.wa.gov/programs/open-data/guidance-open-data-definitions) should not be there.   



Questions for Kathleen:

1. Can she see the domain of every dataset publisher?
2. How did this project originate?
3. Ask Socrata about page views and what is customizable?
4.
