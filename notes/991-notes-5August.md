## Notes August 5

I've started the presentation and the paper is coming along.

The Jupyter Notebook is mostly done.  I fixed several mistakes and I created a dataset today to make all final figures from.

I have not hammered down recommendations yet.  It seems like there are two modes of curation:

1. Behind the scenes desk work: Make data provider names consistent and add a drop down with a controlled vocabulary.  Figure out what datasets could be consolidated. List datasets that should be deleted or moved. Implement a deletion policy. Implement a feedback system.
2. Engagement, Forward facing:  Work with publishers in need to increase quality. Identify datasets that should be up there.  Offer assistance to smaller agencies. Help select agencies create stories. Showcase any use cases.
