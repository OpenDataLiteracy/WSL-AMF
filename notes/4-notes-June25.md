## June 25 Notes

With Nic.

Nic sent a bunch of references on metadata quality assessment and open government data.

Suggested looking into IP addresses

Interview Suggestions:

* Start generic- goal of open data is transparency -  then go to specific experiences.
* For each interview, use a recently posted dataset as an anchor point.  Then move to more general experience with portal
* Suggested question areas:
 * What do the publishers want for feedback from the users of their data?
 * What is the use of the portal internally at the agency?
 * What is the expected mode of access for their published datasets?
* What is unique about state data portals?  How is their use different than city portals?
