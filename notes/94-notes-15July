## Notes July 15

Met with Nic and discussed Medium post draft.  Discussed possibility of a formal study into what portals do about removed or archived datasets and how the process should work.  Need to create a formal question.  The project would involve manual assessment of portals and possibly short conversations with portal managers.

Assessed more datasets

Made progress on python code to create visualizations of portal assests
