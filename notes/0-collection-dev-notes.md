## Collection Development Notes

*Things to consider if the State Library is to curate state datasets*

I should interview publishers who are heavy users but also interview those who could publish what is known as [popular data](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2018/10/16/results-from-analyzing-public-record-requests/)

[OCIO suggestions](https://ocio.wa.gov/programs/open-data/guidance-what-data-publish) - Types of data suggested for publication

**WA Specific Potential Data** : Salmon (population, hatcheries, habitat), Forestry, Beaches (?)...


**Users** : Agencies, Reporters, Nonprofits, Some citizens


**Possible Curation Steps**

*Immediate/Easy*

1. Delete or unpublish test and dummy datasets
2. Create dataset to track deletions/removals
3. Create [Issue board](https://gitlab.com/wapdc/OpenData-Program/wikis/home) for feedback
4. Identify specific needed datasets (perhaps unique to WA)
5. Create a use guide for agencies: How others use portal, possible new uses, quick tips on uploading and adding metadata
6. Track summary statistics over time for portal (maybe use Jupyter Notebook to snapshot statistics and build dataset?)

*Longer Term*

7. Identify current usage for oldest datasets (pre-2015)- Do the datasets still feed to active websites, etc? This probably involves contacting the dataset owners
8. Consolidate distinct year datasets on the same topic
9. Standardize department names and choose either 'data_provided_by' or 'Originator'
10. Improve Titles and Descriptions
 * Include spatial and temporal indicators, no acronyms, description = why and how
11. Write better prompts for metadata elements in upload sections- help users add appropriate metadata.

*The Bulletin Board Strategy*

* Make sure the portal is findable and usable
* Tidy datasets when possible- remove some, fix some metadata, etc
* Seek out really useful datasets that are not represented
