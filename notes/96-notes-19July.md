Notes July 19

Interviewed WSAC yesterday and also finished assessing individual datasets.

Based on a conversation with Kaitlin, started looking into wrting a python script to download specific metadata.  There are multiple json files available and two different APIs, all with different fields.  My plan is to write a script that gets a list of all uids for a Socrata portal and then iterates through those to populate the url for the full metadata record (incl. data dictionary).

Today interviewed followthemoney.org

Submitted the first Medium post as well.
