## July 9 Notes

Assessed ~40 datasets

Interviewed Department of Fish and Wildlife and confirmed one more interview for next week.

Worked on Medium post.

Over the last two days I've looked at various state portals and noticed that each state has unique top datasets.  Is that because the publisher has done a good job with it or because there is a major user need that is being met?
