## Notes about the portal from a high level


Should have a clear policy document

Should control tag vocabulary

Should host the data that agencies source from for visualization on agency page? Does it work like this already?

Perhaps an [annual conference](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/edp_landscaping_insight_report_n4_2018.pdf) of publishers and users would help?
