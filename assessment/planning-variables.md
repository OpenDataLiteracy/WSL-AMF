## Planning Assessment Strategy

### A Sample of Datasets

Aiming for 25% or ~125 datasets as a sample.  I will use a stratified random sample design:  The list of datasets will be divided into
three levels based on the number of downloads and ~40 datasets from each level will be randomly selected evaluated based on the
variables listed below.  I will assign the datasets random numbers and then sort each level by that number to randomly select datasets.
