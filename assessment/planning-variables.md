## Planning Assessment Strategy

A sample of datasets will be used to assess the data level variables listed below.  The complete catalog, or just the datasets, can be assessed for the following:

- Percent overall metadata completeness
- Percent with a description
- Download statistics by publisher
- Number of links to related content (views etc.)
- Total views of dataset plus related content


### A Sample of Datasets

Aiming for 25% or ~125 datasets as a sample.  I will use a stratified random sample design:  The list of datasets will be divided into
three levels based on the number of downloads and ~40 datasets from each level will be randomly selected evaluated based on the
variables listed below.  I will assign the datasets random numbers and then sort each level by that number to randomly select datasets.

### Variables

- Data Assessed
- Publishing Agency
- Number of downloads
- Date of publication
- Date updated
- Date metadata updated
- Percent column descriptions complete
- Is this a one year dataset that is part of ongoing data collection?
- Is the dataset description rich but understandable?
