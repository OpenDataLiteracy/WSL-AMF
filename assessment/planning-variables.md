## Planning Assessment Strategy

A sample of datasets will be used to assess the data level variables listed below.  The complete catalog, or just the datasets, can be assessed for the following:

- Percent overall metadata completeness
- Percent with a description
- Download statistics by publisher
- Number of links to related content (views etc.)
- Total views of dataset plus related content


### A Sample of Datasets

Aiming for 25% or ~125 datasets as a sample.  I will use a stratified random sample design:  The list of datasets will be divided into
three levels based on the number of downloads and ~40 datasets from each level will be randomly selected evaluated based on the
variables listed below.  I will assign the datasets random numbers and then sort each level by that number to randomly select datasets.

Use Kubler et al. (2018) framework?  Also, should capture datasets from early, middle, and late period for the data portal.

The European Open Data Portal Monitor assesses metadata completeness by these variables:
    
> This measure is an average of the missing metadata across a defined set of fields: licence, author, organisation, date released and date updated. 

There is also the open government benchmark proposed by [VeljkoviÂ´c et al. (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740624X14000434)

### Variables

- File format
- Publishing Agency
- Number of downloads
- Date of publication
- Date updated
- Date metadata updated
- Percent column descriptions complete
- Is this a one year dataset that is part of ongoing data collection?
- Is the dataset description rich but understandable?


I should assess based on the [5-stars](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/elearning/en/module10/#/id/co-01)


### Sample of datasets for assessment

- Took 14 datasets from 12 groupings: 
 - # Downloads (<100, >101 but <1500, >1500)
 - Year Created (2012/2013, 2014/2015, 2016,2017, 2018,2019)

Assessment: Assess relevant variables on a 4 point scale: 0 = not present, 1 = no, 2 = somewhat, 3 = yes

> Check to make sure dataset is still published
> Title Understandable?
> Description Helpful?
> Keywords Useful?
