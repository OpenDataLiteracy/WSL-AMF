qxh8-f4bd,ypwc-5ce7,Health Care Provider Credential Data,"Attention: The secretary of health extended health profession license expiration dates for licenses up for renewal between April 1 and September 30, 2020.  This extension allowed health professionals to focus on patient care and to promote continued patient safety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It also provided for a reduction in economic burden for those providers who could not work.  Health professional licenses that expired on September 30, 2020, and are in the renewal process, will be considered by the department as active until October 23, 2020.
Renewal processing delays may occur in October, due to a high volume of renewals being submitted at the end of September.  Users of Provider Credential Search and our Health Care Provider Credential Data on this site are cautioned about using the Last Issue and Expiration dates reflected until renewal processing can be completed.

9nnw-c693,6hhm-htpq,Lobbyist Compensation and Expenses by Source,"This dataset contains compensation and expense summary records from the monthly reports of lobbying activity. One record is included for each client that paid compensation or incurred expenses during the filing period. If the lobbyist firm themselves incurred any expenses not reimbursed by a client, a record is included summarizing the lobbyist firm's expenses. If a lobbyist reported no compensation or expenses on the report, no records will be in this dataset. Records are included for a period of ten years, beginning in January, 2016. The date is determined as the filing period of the report, not the date received. Records are included for the full year so for example, all 2017 records will be included until the entire year 2017 falls outside the 10 year time span.

The dataset includes both original and amended reports and documents. Data consumers must look at the individual documents to determine if a particular document has been superseded by an amendment. For example, a candidate might file a C4 summary report and file an amendment to the report. There is no indicator on the original C4 that it has been amended. For most documents, amendments have the term ""AMENDED"" as part of the origin field but the original document will not contain any indicator that it has been superseded by an amendment.

The telephone survey was conducted using random digit dialing.  To meet the regional planning requirements of the project, the sample was stratified by the 10 planning regions in Washington (see the 2013 SCORP Plan, Appendix A for survey methodology and map). The consultant obtained a minimum of 300 completed interviews in each region.  Within each region, the results were weighted by demographic characteristics so that the sample was representative of residents of that region.  For statewide results, each region was weighted to be in proper proportion to the state population as a whole.  Study findings are representative at the statewide level as well as by planning region.

The WQI ranges from 1 (poor quality) to 100 (good quality). The WQI summary does not include non-standard elements like metals. For temperature, pH, oxygen, and fecal coliform bacteria, the WQI is based on criteria in Washington’s Water Quality Standards, WAC 173-201A. For nutrient and sediment measures where standards are not specific, results are based on expected conditions in a given region. Multiple constituents are combined and results aggregated over time to produce a single score for each station and each year. All current long-term Ecology monitoring stations with at least 5 years data are included.  Most stations are located near the mouths of major streams.  These stations integrate upstream water quality and capture large basin-scale trends. However, status and trends at these locations may not reflect status or trends in any particular sub-basin.

Please refer to the ""Lobbyist Compensation and Expenses by Source"" dataset for 2016 and later records.

This dataset contains compensation and expense summary records from the monthly reports of lobbying activity. One record is included for each client that paid compensation or incurred expenses during the filing period. If the lobbyist firm themselves incurred any expenses not reimbursed by a client, a record is included summarizing the lobbyist firm's expenses. If a lobbyist reported no compensation or expenses on the report, no records will be in this dataset. Records are included for the period from 10 years prior to the current date to the end of 2015. The date is determined as the filing period of the report, not the date received. Records are included for the full year so for example, all 2007 records will be included until the entire year 2007 falls outside the 10 year time span.

8sap-vzbp,x2yz-d38n,"Broadband Adoption and Computer Use by year, state, demographic characteristics","This dataset is imported from the US Department of Commerce, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and its ""Data Explorer"" site.  The underlying data comes from the US Census

1. dataset: Specifies the month and year of the survey as a string, in ""Mon YYYY"" format. The CPS is a monthly survey, and NTIA periodically sponsors Supplements to that survey.

2. variable: Contains the standardized name of the variable being measured. NTIA identified the availability of similar data across Supplements, and assigned variable names to ease time-series comparisons.

3. description: Provides a concise description of the variable.

4. universe: Specifies the variable representing the universe of persons or households included in the variable's statistics. The specified variable is always included in the file. The only variables lacking universes are isPerson and isHouseholder, as they are themselves the broadest universes measured in the CPS.

5. A large number of *Prop, *PropSE, *Count, and *CountSE columns comprise the remainder of the columns. For each demographic being measured (see below), four statistics are produced, including the estimated proportion of the group for which the variable is true (*Prop), the standard error of that proportion (*PropSE), the estimated number of persons or households in that group for which the variable is true (*Count), and the standard error of that count (*CountSE).

DEMOGRAPHIC CATEGORIES

1. us: The usProp, usPropSE, usCount, and usCountSE columns contain statistics about all persons and households in the universe (which represents the population of the fifty states and the District and Columbia). For example, to see how the prevelance of Internet use by Americans has changed over time, look at the usProp column for each survey's internetUser variable.

2. age: The age category is divided into five ranges: ages 3-14, 15-24, 25-44, 45-64, and 65+. The CPS only includes data on Americans ages 3 and older. Also note that household reference persons must be at least 15 years old, so the age314* columns are blank for household-based variables. Those columns are also blank for person-based variables where the universe is ""isAdult"" (or a sub-universe of ""isAdult""), as the CPS defines adults as persons ages 15 or older. Finally, note that some variables where children are technically in the univese will show zero values for the age314* columns. This occurs in cases where a variable simply cannot be true of a child (e.g. the workInternetUser variable, as the CPS presumes children under 15 are not eligible to work), but the topic of interest is relevant to children (e.g. locations of Internet use).

3. work: Employment status is divided into ""Employed,"" ""Unemployed,"" and ""NILF"" (Not in the Labor Force). These three categories reflect the official BLS definitions used in official labor force statistics. Note that employment status is only recorded in the CPS for individuals ages 15 and older. As a result, children are excluded from the universe when calculating statistics by work status, even if they are otherwise considered part of the universe for the variable of interest.

4. income: The income category represents annual family income, rather than just an individual person's income. It is divided into five ranges: below $25K, $25K-49,999, $50K-74,999, $75K-99,999, and $100K or more. Statistics by income group are only available in this file for Supplements beginning in 2010; prior to 2010, family income range is available in public use datasets, but is not directly comparable to newer datasets due to the 2010 introduction of the practice of allocating ""don't know,"" ""refused,"" and other responses that result in missing data. Prior to 2010, family income is unkown for approximately 20 percent of persons, while in 2010 the Census Bureau began imputing likely income ranges to replace missing data.

5. education: Educational attainment is divided into ""No Diploma,"" ""High School Grad,"" ""Some College,"" and ""College Grad."" High school graduates are considered to include GED completers, and those with some college include community college attendees (and graduates) and those who have attended certain postsecondary vocational or technical schools--in other words, it signifies additional education beyond high school, but short of attaining a bachelor's degree or equivilent. Note that educational attainment is only recorded in the CPS for individuals ages 15 and older. As a result, children are excluded from the universe when calculating statistics by education, even if they are otherwise considered part of the universe for the variable of interest.

6. sex: ""Male"" and ""Female"" are the two groups in this category. The CPS does not currently provide response options for intersex individuals.

7. race: This category includes ""White,"" ""Black,"" ""Hispanic,"" ""Asian,"" ""Am Indian,"" and ""Other"" groups. The CPS asks about Hispanic origin separately from racial identification; as a result, all persons identifying as Hispanic are in the Hispanic group, regardless of how else they identify. Furthermore, all non-Hispanic persons identifying with two or more races are tallied in the ""Other"" group (along with other less-prevelant responses). The Am Indian group includes both American Indians and Alaska Natives.

8. disability: Disability status is divided into ""No"" and ""Yes"" groups, indicating whether the person was identified as having a disability. Disabilities screened for in the CPS include hearing impairment, vision impairment (not sufficiently correctable by glasses), cognitive difficulties arising from physical, mental, or emotional conditions, serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs, difficulty dressing or bathing, and difficulties performing errands due to physical, mental, or emotional conditions. The Census Bureau began collecting data on disability status in June 2008; accordingly, this category is unavailable in Supplements prior to that date. Note that disability status is only recorded in the CPS for individuals ages 15 and older. As a result, children are excluded from the universe when calculating statistics by disability status, even if they are otherwise considered part of the universe for the variable of interest.

9. metro: Metropolitan status is divided into ""No,"" ""Yes,"" and ""Unkown,"" reflecting information in the dataset about the household's location. A household located within a metropolitan statistical area is assigned to the Yes group, and those outside such areas are assigned to No. However, due to the risk of de-anonymization, the metropolitan area status of certain households is unidentified in public use datasets. In those cases, the Census Bureau has determined that revealing this geographic information poses a disclosure risk. Such households are tallied in the Unknown group.

aqa5-4cee,b2pf-39fu,"Educational Attainment of Washington Population by Age, Race/Ethnicity/, and PUMA Region","The American Community Survey (ACS) is designed to estimate the characteristic distribution of populations* and estimated counts should only be used to calculate percentages. They do not represent the actual population counts or totals. Beginning in 2019, the Washington Student Achievement Council (WSAC) has measured educational attainment for the Roadmap Progress Report using one-year American Community Survey (ACS) data from the United States Census Bureau. These public microdata represents the most current data, but it is limited to areas with larger populations leading to some multi-county regions**. 

*The American Community Survey is not the official source of population counts. It is designed to show the characteristics of the nation's population and should not be used as actual population counts or housing totals for the nation, states or counties.  The official population count — including population by age, sex, race and Hispanic origin — comes from the once-a-decade census, supplemented by annual population estimates (which do not typically contain educational attainment variables) from the following groups and surveys:  
  -- Washington State Office of Financial Management (OFM): 
      https://www.ofm.wa.gov/washington-data-research/population-demographics
  -- US Census Decennial Census: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html and Population Estimates Program: https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html

**In prior years, WSAC used both the five-year and three-year (now discontinued) data. While the 5-year estimates provide a larger sample, they are not recommended for year to year trends and also are released later than the one-year files.
