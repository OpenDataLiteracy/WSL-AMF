## Assessment of all assets

Cleaned the 24 June dataset:

1. Fix the create and update date column formats
2. Delete obvious test datasets (search test and dummy, but watch out for lead test results from Asset_data sheet (the community datasets are still in there and also in the removed datasets sheet)
3. Remove community datasets, only use official, for PUBLISH sheet
4. Can't just rely on PUBLIC datasets because there are sume not public ones that are accessed by public assets

The working list is Published assets that are official and are either public or not. All derived assets have a parent in the list

Derived datasets pull metadata from underlying dataset so do not include those in assessment.
