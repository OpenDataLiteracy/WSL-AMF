## Keyword Analysis

Keywords should not be the same as the title.

Looked at the sample of datasets:

* Counted the number of keywords that matched one of more words in the title
* Counted a keyword as dublicate if keyword was not plural but the duplicate word was (assuming have the plural would show up for singular searchers.  If the word showed up in the title as singular and keyword was plural, then did not count as duplicate.
* Flagged a dataset if the department name/acronym was included in the keyword and exits in title or 'data_provided_by.'
* Did not look at description because of the complexity of that task and curating to that level seems unreasonable.
