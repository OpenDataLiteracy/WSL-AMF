# ODL Summer Internship Agreement

*Updated 05.23.2019*

## Purpose   
The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to the intern and mentor (aka mentor or sponsor) about project, communication and other expectations during the ODL Summer Internship.

## Project Timeline
ODL summer internship projects will run 8 weeks from June to August depending on intern and mentor availability. It is possible for interns and mentors to arrange alternate timelines. If an alternate timeline is agreed upon, this should be documented in the Plan of Work so that there is a clear plan for completing the project expectations and deliverables.

### Pre Internship:
- Interns and ODL staff will meet for a ninety-minute onboarding session on June 20th at 12:00 (PDT) (in-person or via Zoom depending on the intern’s location).
- The Plan of Work document should be completed by June 17th. *This is not optional*. This plan will outline the overall goal of the project, intermediate deliverables, and a final summative deliverable. (Note: it is not unusual for the plan of work to evolve over the course of the internship; it can be a living document, but it must have a completed first draft by June 17th.)

### Internships:
- Interns will be responsible for a weekly check-in with their mentor, and ODL staff (described below).
- Interns will document their progress on a weekly basis using their Github repository.
  - Interns are encouraged to use the [Issues](https://github.com/OpenDataLiteracy/WSL-AMF/issues) and [Projects](https://github.com/OpenDataLiteracy/WSL-AMF/projects) capabilities of Github for Project Management. Tag Nic (@nniiicc) and Bree (@norlab) in Issues for help. 
- Interns will be responsible for all deliverables, and a sustainability plan described in the Plan of Work.
- Interns will be responsible for at least 2 public blogs posts on [ODL’s Medium publication](https://medium.com/open-data-literacy) throughout the summer.
- Interns will be responsible for making 1 public presentation of their work at the internship. This will occur at the ODL Intern Showcase on Friday, August 16th from 2-4:30 in Mary Gates Hall 258. 

## Project Communication

## Responsibilities of interns:
- Interns should communicate with their mentors (either in person or by video-conference) at least weekly, and are encouraged to communicate more frequently as needed.
- Interns should aim to respond to mentors’ emails within one business day.   
- Interns are encouraged to participate in Slack channel discussions, weekly lunches, and get-togethers with other ODL interns throughout the summer. The schedule is as follows:
  - June 20th 12:00: **required** on-boarding meeting
  - June 27th 4:00: *optional* (but encouraged) Happy Hour at [Schultzy’s on the Ave](https://www.shultzys.com/)
  - July 11th 12:00: *optional* (but encouraged) Lunch in Mary Gates 372
  - July 25th 4:00: *optional* (but encouraged) Happy Hour at [Schultzy’s on the Ave](https://www.shultzys.com/)
  - August 8th 12:00: *optional* (but encouraged) Lunch in Mary Gates 372

## Expectations of mentors (aka partners or sponsors):
Mentors are expected to meet with interns, in person or remotely, prior to the start date of the internship to craft Plan of Work with a clearly defined scope and set of deliverables. ODL expects the 2019 projects to be data-driven. (We are not looking for projects with a focus on the creation of educational materials or presentations.) Mentors are expected to keep track of the time they spend working on the internship for cost-share reporting purposes.

- Mentors are expected to check in with interns at least weekly, and aim to be available for more frequent communication when requested or needed.  
- Mentors are expected to respond to intern emails promptly unless arrangements have been made with the intern (due to out-of-office time or other unavailability). If the mentor is unavailable a back-up contact person should be provided to the intern.
- Mentors will solicit the participation of secondary mentors and external collaborators where needed.
- Mentors will alert ODL team members if the project is delayed or off-track, and are strongly encouraged to update ODL staff about any noteworthy outcomes from the project either during or after the project end date.
