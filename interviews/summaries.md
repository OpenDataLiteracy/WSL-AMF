## Interview Summaries

**Public disclosure Commission:**  --High quality metadata, update datsets 4x a day, superusers--
- Open data is basically part of their mission
- Excellent [system to engage with users](https://gitlab.com/wapdc/OpenData-Program/issues)
- They know their users very well, large websites, reporters, some citizens
- data.wa.gov hosts all their data and they create visualizations on their website for those data
- They requests some information from other agencies through email (like voter registration info)
- They sometimes use data.wa.gov to find other information (e.g. to help reporters)
- Their use will increase in the future
- Without data.wa.gov, they would not have been able to do what they've done.
- Very supportive of portal, especially that it's a free resource


**Salmon Recovery/Recreation and Conservation** --Highly downloaded datasets, metadata is mediocre, sophisticated user--
- Use the portal as an authoratative source for datasets (rather than wondering if an emailed dataset is the right version)
- Request other agencies to put their data on portal and maintain it (e.g. Ecology)
- They know other agencies use their data and they are happy to not have to hear from them for data requests
- They use data.wa.gov to find spatial data and legacy datasets (e.g. old data that was not appended with new data)
- They are waiting for PowerBI Online to launch and will switch to that from Tableau- Want all their data to be live
- data.wa.gov is integral to their operations and they've invested time and energy into it
- They use data.wa.gov to publish data to sharepoint because no other tool does that.  They hope any future changes won't mess that up.


**Department of Fish and Wildife** --Lots of datasets of varying quality--
- Started publishing to data.wa.gov because it is free
- They do know some of their users and publish in demand data (e.g. creel reports, albacore tuna data)
- There are over 1 million licenses for fishing and hunting so those are all potential users
- Thought Federal Gov uses some data (e.g. fish tag data)
- They share dta with other agencies using their database
- They hope to have live data in the future
- A big problem is 'getting their house in order' in terms of data governance
- Their website has lots of data that is not on data.wa.gov and they would need a top down push from within the agency to change that.
- They are interested in future direction of open data for the state.

**Arts Commission** --One main dataset, good metadata, basic users--
- Started publishing after writing grant to build a public facing art database
- Open data aligns with their push for transparency
- They update several times a year and find Socrata overall easy to use
- They've noticed useful software changes (no longer have to clear cache to see changes)
- They really liked a feature that allowed them to filter data based on legislative district
- Plan to continue updating their data.
- Would like to learn more about putting visualizations on their website using data from data.wa.gov
- Are interested in regular open data updates from OCIO, and suggestions on how to use portal and data.
