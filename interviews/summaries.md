## Interview Summaries

**PDC:**  --High quality metadata, update datsets 4x a day, superusers--
- Open data is basically part of their mission
- Excellent [system to engage with users](https://gitlab.com/wapdc/OpenData-Program/issues)
- They know their users very well, large websites, reporters, some citizens
- data.wa.gov hosts all their data and they create visualizations on their website for those data
- They requests some information from other agencies through email (like voter registration info)
- They sometimes use data.wa.gov to find other information (e.g. to help reporters)
- Their use will increase in the future
- Without data.wa.gov, they would not have been able to do what they've done.
- Very supportive of portal, especially that it's a free resource

**Salmon Recovery/Recreation and Conservation** --Highly downloaded datasets, metadata is mediocre--
- Use the portal as an authoratative source of data
- Request other agencies to put their data on portal and maintain it (e.g. Ecology)
- They know other agencies use their data and they are happy to not have to hear from them for data requests
- They use data.wa.gov to find spatial data and legacy datasets (e.g. old data that was not appended with new data)
- They are waiting for PowerBI Online to launch and will switch to that from Tableau- Want all their data to be live
- data.wa.gov is integral to their operations and they've invested time and energy into it
- They use data.wa.gov to publish data to sharepoint because no other tool does that.  They hope any future changes won't mess that up.
