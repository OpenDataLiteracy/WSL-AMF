## Interview Summaries

**Public disclosure Commission:**  --High quality metadata, update datsets 4x a day, superusers--
- Open data is basically part of their mission
- Excellent [system to engage with users](https://gitlab.com/wapdc/OpenData-Program/issues)
- They know their users very well, large websites, reporters, some citizens
- data.wa.gov hosts all their data and they create visualizations on their website for those data
- They requests some information from other agencies through email (like voter registration info)
- They sometimes use data.wa.gov to find other information (e.g. to help reporters)
- Their use will increase in the future
- Without data.wa.gov, they would not have been able to do what they've done.
- Very supportive of portal, especially that it's a free resource


**Salmon Recovery/Recreation and Conservation** --Highly downloaded datasets, metadata is mediocre, sophisticated user--
- Use the portal as an authoratative source for datasets (rather than wondering if an emailed dataset is the right version)
- They publish data on standard metrics for their work- not much guesswork is needed
- Request other agencies to put their data on portal and maintain them (e.g. Ecology)
- They know other agencies use their data and they are happy to not have to hear from them for data requests
- They use data.wa.gov to find spatial data and legacy datasets (e.g. old data that was not appended with new data)
- They are waiting for PowerBI Online to launch and will switch to that from Tableau- Want all their data to be live
- data.wa.gov is integral to their operations and they've invested time and energy into it
- They use data.wa.gov to publish data to sharepoint because no other tool does that.  They hope any future changes won't mess that up.


**Department of Fish and Wildife** --Lots of datasets of varying quality--
- Started publishing to data.wa.gov because it is free
- They do know some of their users and publish in demand data (e.g. creel reports, albacore tuna data)
- There are over 1 million licenses for fishing and hunting so those are all potential users
- Thought Federal Gov uses some data (e.g. fish tag data)
- They share dta with other agencies using their database
- They hope to have live data in the future
- A big problem is 'getting their house in order' in terms of data governance
- Their website has lots of data that is not on data.wa.gov and they would need a top down push from within the agency to change that.
- They are interested in future direction of open data for the state.

**Arts Commission** --One main dataset, good metadata, basic users--
- Started publishing after writing grant to build a public facing art database
- Open data aligns with their push for transparency
- They update several times a year and find Socrata overall easy to use
- They've noticed useful software changes (no longer have to clear cache to see changes)
- They really liked a feature that allowed them to filter data based on legislative district
- Plan to continue updating their data.
- Would like to learn more about putting visualizations on their website using data from data.wa.gov
- Are interested in regular open data updates from OCIO, and suggestions on how to use portal and data.

**Office of the Superindendent** --Started using portal in last month, sophisticated visualizations on website--
- Uploaded about 20 years of data within last month.  Most of it pulled from their old reportcard site.
- Plan on using portal as a repository and use their Tableau server as source data for website visualizations.  Portal is ADA and is accessible
- Currently have lots of datasets individual by year, eventually plan on combining and updating annually.
- They say Socrata works fine for individual dataset uploads, hard to do multiple at once.
- Put data up that they are required to make available or can make public
- Users are district staff, university researchers, nonprofits (especially ones applying for grants and needing data).
- They used to send users to old reportcard site, Now use data.wa.gov but find the search is very difficult.  Have to send spcific URL
- Suggest search could be better if able to search by agency, and if datasets could be marked as 'certified'- other agencies put up some of their data and it was an old version.
- They do not really use the portal to get data from other agencies
- In the future they hope to consolidate datasets rather than add more
- Also hope to send users to their website rather than the portal- portal visualizations and search are too limiting
- Would love to see some curation to assist in comparing data from different levels, e.g. county level to district level.

**Student Achievement Council** -- Just started publishing --
- Started publishing in January, used to make data available as excel files on website
- Started with a dataset frequently requested and with few privacy concerns: College bound scholarship rates
- Excel files are source for Tableau dashboards
- Really liked that portal could take in a dataset and make it an open resource very easily.
- Did get some complaints about difficulty using portal- learning curve. E.g. only seeing sample of data in preview and wondering if that was it.
- Future plans unclear.  Data champion is no longer at WSAC.  Had planned on putting up 30-40 more datasets.
- Interviewee uses the portal all the time to get data, from OPSI, and others.  Uses geo.wa.gov too.  Wishes some other agencies would use it too.
- Media is a major user of WSAC data (college and scholarship rates)
- Wishes the portal had a data suppression feature (e.g. hide any row with fewer than 10 in given columns)
- Initially difficult for WSAC to decide who would run the open data program (IT, communications, external affairs, etc)

**followthemoney.org** --User of disclosure data--
- Thinks WA portal (specifically PDC data) is among the best
- Gave her feedback on some needed columns and PDC did it immediately.
- Likes that ALL the data from the forms is available, rather than the agency choosing what they think are important.
- In CA she has to request the data and they send a disk, others, the data is only partially complete compared to the submitted disclosure forms.
- She likes the filtering abilities of the Socrata platform.
- Downloads data directly rather than use API
- Use depends on elections each year, expects to download Campaign Finance data 6-8 times next year.   Lobbiest data once a year and independet spending data ~3 times a year.
- At some portals she has to compare an actual submitted disclusre report to the corresponding data in the data file in order to figure out what some columns mean ---> importance of good metadata.
- Wishes that she could select data by filer ID rather than election year

**Ecology Solid Waste** --Has data on there uploaded 2017, just removed some datasets--
- A few years ago they wanted more data available online. One of their data teams wanted to put up data around the 14-16 indicators in the solid and hazardous waste plan.  These get reported in the Progress Report. data.wa.gov seemed like a good option.
- In past, they put excel files and charts on website.  But they wanted people to be able to interact with data.
- With few resources, they teamed up with iSchool students who formatted and uploaded datasets that have since not been touched (The students are dataset owners though the contact email is an employee)
- Just as they got it all up there, Ecology went through a website redo and they lost their web coordinator so plans for visualizations fell by the wayside.
- Users: Local WA governments, WA county recycling coordinators, NGOs/nonprofits.  EPA probably uses it.  The public is probably not a big user.
- Interviewee fills data requests by sending email with attached file.
- Data.wa.gov: Interviewee has not used data from there for job, but has perused to see what might be available from other agencies, then goes to agency website and either gets data or contacts someone.  data.wa.gov involves lots of scrolling, categories are not helpful.
- Future data plans: Looking at other options like Tableau and PowerBI. Want to move away from data.wa.gov.  There was a push to use POwerBI but then they realized the plan was to not make that public facing so they ditched that effort.
- Ecology uses Explorer (or Edge?) and supposedly this does not function well with Socrata.
- Interviewee recently deleted datasets because those numbers were not going to be part of the next progress report.
- Interviewee was interested to learn how other agencies were using portal.
