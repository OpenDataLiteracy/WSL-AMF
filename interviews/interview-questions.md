## Interview Questions

I am an intern with the University of Washington iSchool’s Open Data Literacy program and I am working with the State Library to assess the State’s open data portal.  It’s about seven years old and we are interested in understanding how state agencies use it and how it can be improved as a resource.  As an agency that publishes data to the portal, you may have important insights.


* What is your experience with the open data portal?
* Why does your agency publish data to data.wa.gov?
* How do you choose what data to publish?
* What challenges do you face publishing data on data.wa.gov?
* Do you know who uses your data?
* Does your agency use data.wa.gov to find data?
* When needed, how does your agency obtain information from other agencies?
* Is there anything else you think I should know?
