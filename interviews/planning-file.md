### Interview planning notes


10-15 total interviews, 4-5 of which from users (publishers may know some users)

What do data publishers know about their users? What are they doing to understand their users

Any best practices from literature on how to identify users?

Will need to record interviews


**Interview List**

*Major Users:*
- Chadd Bennett, Assistant Director of Digital Information, Washington Student Achievement Council
  - High end user of portal, may feel limited by portal features (per Will Saunders)
- Cristie Fredrickson, Chief Information Officer, Department of Ecology
- Matthew Oram, Chief Information Officer, Department of Fish and Wildlife

*Mid-level Users*



**Communication Notes**

Chadd Bennett: Will gave him my information and he emailed me. He's moving to Chicago week of 17June but I asked if we could do a video interview in the next few weeks.
