### Interview planning notes


10-15 total interviews, 4-5 of which from users (publishers may know some users)

What do data publishers know about their users? What are they doing to understand their users

Any best practices from literature on how to identify users?

Will need to record interviews


**Interview List**

*Major Users:*  High number of datasets (>20) and or high number of downloads
- Cristie Fredrickson, Chief Information Officer, Department of Ecology
- Matthew Oram, Chief Information Officer, Department of Fish and Wildlife
- Office of Juvenile Justice
- Washington State Department of Health
- Department of Ecology and Department of Fish and Wildlife (I'll choose one)
- 


*Mid-level Users* Have uploaded 10-20 datasets and/or have around 500 downloads
- Washington State Arts Commission: high downloads
- Office of the superintendent of Public Schools

*Low-level Users* Have 1-9 datasets and/or fewer than 500 downloads
- Chadd Bennett, Assistant Director of Digital Information, Washington Student Achievement Council
  - May feel limited by portal features (per Will Saunders). WSAC has tons of dashboards on their site
- Washington Recreation and Conservation Office
- 


**Communication Notes**

Chadd Bennett: Will gave him my information and he emailed me. He's moving to Chicago week of 17June but I asked if we could do a video interview in the next few weeks. I will email him July 9th for an interview during the week of July 15.
