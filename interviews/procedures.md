## Procedures

In advance of each interview spend ~1 hour in preparation. This should include: 
- Recording relevant facts about the person, and their position. Think of this as building a profile of the person before you sit down to interview them. 
- Tailor your questionnaire to specific things that this individual will be helpful for understanding 
- Check recording equipment to make sure it is functioning properly. 

Anonymity: 
- In advance of each interview you should create an identifier scheme for your participants. Here is a simple example I use - Position Title - Order in which I interviewed the person - Day of the month that I interviewed the person. So an identifier might look like `PO-2-19` ... I interviewed a Police Officer as the second participant in my study on the 19th of the month. 
- Participants should be referred to in your notes, file names, and in future publications by this identifier

At each interview: 
- Introduce yourself, the ODL project, and state the goals of your particular internship
- Tell them that their participation is voluntary and either ask them to sign consent form or explain consent on audio-recording
- DO NOT begin audio recording until you have consent. If you are planning on verbal consent - start audio recorder and re-ask for consent once you begin recording. 
- Use two audio recording devices

During interview: 
- Record notes in a separate document - and be sure to note the date and location. 
- Record times where particularly useful dialogue occurs - this will help to locate quotes in the future 

After each interview:
- Spend 30 minutes writing notes about impression of interview, things to follow up on, and adding any new notes to your questionnaire. 
- Check your primary recording and make sure it recorded entire interview. 

Storage: 
- You must store data on password protected machine. Your laptop is fine for this. 
- Store your notes and audio recording in a folder with the participants identifier. 
- You should also create a separate private repository and upload your notes and audio to this repository. Invite me to this repository so that I can help manage the data after you complete the internship.
